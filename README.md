Scripts to compute the criticality of the Turing bifurcation

Files 'Criticality.py', 'functions.py' and 'Plotter.nb' must be placed into the same folder to run the script.

Create different directories for different models and place a file called 'name_of_the_directory.py' with all the required variables indicated in it.

The only thing that remains to be done is running the script 'Criticality.py' and write the name of the directory as the first input when you are asked to enter it. After that, get into the folder and run the Mathematica file 'Plotter.nb' that will be already copied (provided that all the variables were well-provided) into the directory of your system for you.
